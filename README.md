Track Your Expenses v1

TYE (pronounced as tie) is a software system that helps you track your expenses. The idea is simple. You enter the amount you have spent on purchasing a product in the system. The system keeps record of what you have entered and provides analytics based on the gathered information.

The primary uses cases covered in first version are:

1. An Item Master that allows lookups for items you buy.
2. Ability to select an item from the Item Master and associate a price with the item.
3. List all the items you have bought along with their prices.

The proposed system will be built using Python and Django.
